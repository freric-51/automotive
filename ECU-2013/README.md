# ECU-Engine Control Unit

It was my school task, a Powertrain Control Module for monopoint injection engine.

The source has a bat file (build.bat) to inform the CCS compiler how to procedure as the same to the doxygen to generate the documentation that I renamed to 'ECU EFI PCM Powertrain Control Module.pdf' (processa_pdf.bat).

I also made a video with the final tests and everything worked very well. **I got picked by the teacher for a drive around the school yard with the car** :
