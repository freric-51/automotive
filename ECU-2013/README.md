# ECU-2013

It was my school task, a Powertrain Control Module for monopoint injection engine.

The files with extension .ba_ has to be changed to .bat

The source has a bat file (build.ba_) to inform the CCS compiler how to procedure as the same to the doxygen to generate the documentation (processa_pdf.ba_).

I extracted, renamed and put the doc "ECU EFI PCM Powertrain Control Module.pdf" in root files to help everyone to read the source code.

I also made a video with the final tests :
